i was cheated by you
and i think you know when

so i've made up my mind
it must come to an end

look at me now
will i ever learn?
i don't know how
but i suddenly lose control
there's a fire within my soul

just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
woah-oah

mamma mia!
here i go again
my my
how can i resist ya

mamma mia!
does it show again
my my
just how much i've missed ya

yes i've been broken hearted
blue since the day we parted
why why did i ever let you go

mamma mia
now i really know
my my
i should not have let you go

i was angry and sad
when i knew we were through
i can't count all the times
i have cried over you

look at me now
will i ever learn?
i don't know how
but i suddenly lose control
there's a fire within my soul

just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
woah-ah

mamma mia!
here i go again
my my
how can i resist ya

mamma mia!
does it show again
my my
just how much i've missed ya

yes i've been broken hearted
blue since the day we parted
why why did i ever let you go

mamma mia!
now i really know
my my
i should not have let you go


DONNA: "i'm dreaming, aren't i? you aren't really here?"

SAM: "would you like me to pinch you?"

DONNA: "you keep your hands to yourself >:("

SAM: "you've changed your tune..."

DONNA: "what the HELL are you doing here, sam? what are any of you doing here? i'm sorry. i'm just - amazed to see you all"

BILL: "well i'm - doing a piece for a magazine..."

HARRY: "i'm here for a holiday"

SAM: "i thought i'd just drop in and say hi.."

*DONNA narrows her eyes at him, then decides she mustn't let him rattle her*
DONNA: "oh, dear - what a shame - we don't have any rooms. it's that time of year..."

SAM: "just as well i booked ahead"
(to BILL and HARRY)
"you two can bunk down with me if they're really full"

DONNA: "this is so - inconvenient!"

SAM: "why?"

DONNA: "because... one of the local girls is getting married tomorrow, and i just don't have the staff to cope with you -
you'd be so much more comfortable on the mainland"

SAM: "not at all. bill's used to suffering for his art and head-banger here's the last word in spontaneous"

DONNA: "what about you?"

SAM: "i came here to see the island. you know what it meant to me"

DONNA: "well, i'd love to stop and chew over old times, but i have to go and.. clean out my purse"
*DONNA exits*

HARRY: "age cannot wither her..."

BILL: "i was expecting a frumpy little housewife"

SAM: "no- she's still donna"
